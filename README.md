# Data-Visualization
> Data visualization is an important aspect of machine learning that helps in understanding the data better and making decisions based on insights. It involves creating various visualizations like charts, plots, graphs, and maps that represent data in a meaningful way.
Data visualization can help in identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in the data, which can then be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. It can also help in identifying data quality issues like missing values and outliers, which can be cleaned before training the models.
In addition, data visualization can help in communicating the insights and results to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner. It can be used to create dashboards, reports, and presentations that provide a summary of the analysis and the key takeaways.

## Contents
- Line chart
> A line chart is a graph that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight lines. It is commonly used to show the trend of a variable over time.
- Bar chart
> A bar chart is a graph that represents categorical data with rectangular bars, where the height or length of each bar corresponds to the value of the category it represents. It is commonly used to compare different categories or groups.
- Histogram
> A histogram is a graph that displays the distribution of a continuous variable. It groups the data into bins or intervals and shows the frequency of observations in each bin as a bar.
- Scatter Plot
> A scatter plot is a graph that displays the relationship between two continuous variables as a collection of points on a two-dimensional plane. It is commonly used to explore the correlation or association between two variables.
- Heatmap
> A heatmap is a graphical representation of data that uses color-coded cells to represent different values. It is commonly used to show the correlation or relationship between multiple variables at once.
